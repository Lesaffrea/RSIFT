RSIFT is an R implementation of the SIFT method for detecting key points within images.

If you are looking at this, then you probably already know what SIFT is, and you're probably asking the question... Why R???  Truth be told, R is notoriously slow and is by its nature, single threaded.

However, it proves a good exercise for one wanting to grind through the details of an algorithm without leaning on an existing library for support.
